abstract="We study the polynomial{\$}{\$}{\backslash}Phi {\backslash}left( {\{}x,y{\}} {\backslash}right) = {\backslash}prod {\{}{\_}{\{}j = 0{\}}^{\{}p - 1{\}} {\backslash}left( {\{}1 - xw^j  - yw^{\{}qj{\}} {\}} {\backslash}right){\}} {\$}{\$}, where $\omega$ is a primitivepth root of unity. This polynomial arises in CR geometry [1]. We show that it is the determinant of thep{\texttimes}p circulant matrix whose first row is (1, −x,0,{\ldots},0,−y,0,{\ldots},0), the −y being in positionq+1. Therefore, the coefficients of this polynomial $\Phi$ are integers that count certain classes of permutations. We show that all of the permutations that contribute to a fixed monomialxrys in $\Phi$ have the same sign, and we determine that sign. We prove that a monomialxrys appears in $\Phi$ if and only ifp dividesr+sq. Finally, we show that the size of the largest coefficient of the monomials in $\Phi$ grows exponentially withp, by proving that the permanent of the circulant whose first row is (1, 1, 0, {\ldots}, 0, 1, 0, {\ldots}, 0) is the sum of the absolute values of the monomials in the polynomial $\Phi$.",
